# Carbon Cast - A Carbon Emission Predictor ðŸ’¨ 

## Introduction 
By Justin:

This project uses 6 years of historical data from (Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3) to predict forecast values of carbon emission to 2050. For Scope 2, the values used are based off market-based. The data is extracted from Meta, Fujitsu, Amazon, Google and Google sustainability report. It is targeted to users, company or anyone who has interest in looking at the forecasted values of carbon emission using of Scope 1, 2 and 3. It also allow users to upload their csv data file of historical data to predict (with one of my trained model) the forecasted values up to 2050.

## About this Data

This projects uses Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon missions downloaded from the sustainability reports from the respective companies (Meta, Google, Amazon, Fujitsu, Microsoft).

## Limitations

Currently, our model is trained on 6 years of historical data for Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions. For the model to have more accurate prediction, we would require a minimum of 10-20 years of historical data to forecast accurarely into 2050.

Users that upload their csv data are now being trained on the existing model, to forecast the output. However, if the user csv data are trained based off their own data, the forecasted values will be more accurate and precise.


## Conclusion

This project successfully delivers a user-friendly streamlit application for forecasting data up to 2050 which is the main goal for many companies and countries around the world. They are also able to input their data, users can gain valuable insights into potential future trends and values. The application offers flexibility by allowing users to upload their own CSV files for customized analysis. Additionally, the ability to download forecasted results empowers users to conduct further exploration and integrate the data into their workflows.
